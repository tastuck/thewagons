### Key Takeaways

What have you learned or practiced during this semester that aided in the completion of your project.

### Core Webpages

**Home Page:** This will be the main landing point for users, featuring highlights from each festival and trending artists. It will include direct links to each festival page, making navigation simple and efficient. Lastly, the home page may feature a quick access button to the favorites page allowing users to revisit their saved interests quickly.

**Festival Pages:**

- Cochella (2017)
- Rock in Rio (2011)
- Tomorrowland (2024)
- Lollapalooza (2021)
- Dreamville (2025)
- Desert Daze (0000)
- Camp Flog Gnaw (0000)

Each page will feature detailed information about each festival including, artist lineups, maps, picture galleries, and stage information. Users will be have the option to favorite specific festivals, stages, or images for easy access later.

### Design Choices & Local Storage Design

We will be using black for our nav and dark backgrounds to make the photos and logos from each festival pop. Most of the festival websites use this styling technique. I will be referencing the following websites:
[Lollapalooza](https://www.lollapalooza.com/)
[Desert Daze](https://desertdaze.org/)
[Coachella](https://www.coachella.com/)

We will be using local storage for user login information and a "my favorites" section. Usernames and passwords will be in local storage. We will have logic for correct and incorrect passwords based off the stored data as well as logic to prompt a new user. We will allow users to favorite certain festivals and that information will be stored locally. We will then have a section that pulls those favorites from local storage and displays them.

### Members & Responsibilities

The members of this group are Taniya (The President and Analyst), Elizabeth (The Architect), Juliana (The Designer), and Chandler (The Scrum Master). Each member is responsible for two pages, which will be about two different music festivals, except for Elizabeth, who is responsible for the home page and one page about a music festival. Taniya's music festivals are Camp Flog Gnaw and Desert Daze, Elizabeth's music festivals are Coachella, Juliana's music festivals are Rock in Rio and Tomorrowland, and Chandler's music festivals are Lollapalooza and Dreamville.
